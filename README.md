# Mutiny

[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

Mutiny aims to provide developers with an easy to use experience similar to `create-react-app`, but for developing standalone extensions/addons for Valve's Steam Deck. Mutiny simplifies the process by providing high level abstractions that can be used to inject custom **React** code into the decks user interface.

## Features

- üî• Hot reloading
- üíª Server support for calling OS commands
- ‚öôÔ∏è CLI for creating new projects (coming soon)
- ü™ù Hooks for the Steam Deck's MobX stores (coming soon)
- üì¶ Packager for creating one-click installers (coming soon)
